                    I have a deep-seated passion for building brands from the ground up,
                    and it has become a cherished endeavor since attending an illustrator class
                    in 2020. Ever since, I have wholeheartedly immersed myself in the art of
                    creating captivating logos and visually striking brand visuals, both for
                    commercial ventures and personal enjoyment. Continuously striving for growth
                    and improvement, I actively seek opportunities to refine my skills and broaden
                    my expertise, with the ultimate aim of showcasing a remarkable portfolio of
                    my creative endeavors.

                    Having attended a Photoshop class in 2021 following my illustrator training,
                    I furthered my skills in graphic design. I gained valuable experience as
                    a part-time graphic designer at a gaming news page for six months, which
                    deepened my understanding of the craft. Continuously seeking improvement,
                    I strive to create extraordinary visuals by combining my proficiency in
                    Illustrator and Photoshop, contributing to a remarkable portfolio of my creative work.

                    HTML, being an essential language for web development, is relatively easy to grasp
                    in terms of learning basic tags and sorting techniques. However, understanding
                    the unique characteristics of each tag can be challenging. Engaging in assignments
                    like this has been instrumental in enhancing my knowledge of HTML, and I am motivated
                    to continue improving my skills in this language. With persistence, I am confident
                    that I will further excel in HTML and leverage its full potential in web development.

                    Having a foundation in basic layouts and creating aesthetics looks
                    greatly benefits me in front-end development. However, despite careful planning,
                    I find the implementation using CSS to be quite challenging. Drawing inspiration
                    from the work of others helps to alleviate some of the difficulties, making
                    the process slightly easier. Nevertheless, I remain committed to continuous
                    improvement and strive to enhance my CSS skills to become even better in my craft.

                    Even though not still being able to use javascript in building a web, I still
                    find it a fun programming language and is quite easy to understand. I hope soon
                    I will be a lot better in this language
